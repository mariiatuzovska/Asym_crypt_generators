# generators
Realised generators (in c#) for gettinng random (numbers) sequences  and tests on independance, equability and uniformity of random sequences.

hi, it's me. 
there are samples of realization of [generators](https://github.com/mariiatuzovska/generators/blob/master/Generators.cs). Here they are: 

* basic Random() in c#;
* [Linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator);
* L20;
* L89;
* [Geffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_attack);
* [Blum Blum Shub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum_Blum_Shub);
* Librarian.

and [tests](https://github.com/mariiatuzovska/generators/blob/master/Criteria.cs) of random sequences on Equabilyty, Independence, Uniformity.
